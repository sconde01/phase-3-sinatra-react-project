# Phase 3 Project at Flatiron School

This is a project that I completed while attending Flatiron School as a Software Engineer student. My idea for this project was to create a Goal and Task Tracker--where one can create a goal and then create tasks for that goal. 

## Learning Goal for this project:

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Requirements
* Ruby 2.7.4
* Node version 16.13.2


## Installation Instructions
1. fork / clone over repository
2. bundle install
3. cd into client and npm install

## Usage
1. cd into client and run npm start
2. run bundle exec rake server 
3. navigate in brq to https://localhost/3000

## Stretch Future Goals
In the future, I would want to click into each task, it have a time tracker and the ability to create a journal entry for that task all in hopes to track productivity and progress.
